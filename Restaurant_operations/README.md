# Restaurant Management Project

## Overview

This project presents a practical application of data engineering concepts within the context of a restaurant management system. Through the development of this system, various aspects of data engineering have been explored, focusing primarily on database management and integration with Python for automation and interaction.

## Tools Used

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Python Connection**: mysql-connector-python
- **Workbench**: MySQL Workbench

## Steps Executed

1. **Database Design**: Defined a relational database schema tailored to the needs of a restaurant, considering factors such as table relationships, normalization, and data integrity.

2. **Data Modeling**: Utilized MySQL Workbench to visually design the database schema, represented by the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER.png). The final database created may differ slightly from the initial conceptual design based on practical considerations and requirements.

3. **Stored Procedures**: Implemented stored procedures to encapsulate complex SQL logic within the database, promoting modularity, security, and performance.

4. **Python Integration**: Utilized Python scripts to interact with the database, enabling automation of tasks such as data insertion, retrieval, and analysis.

## Concept Execution

- **Database Normalization**: Applied normalization techniques to ensure the efficient organization of data and minimize redundancy in the database schema.

- **Data Integrity Constraints**: Enforced data integrity through the implementation of primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and other integrity constraints.


## Future Enhancements

- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for restaurant staff to interact with the system, facilitating tasks such as order management and customer service.

- **Data Analytics**: Integrate data analytics capabilities to analyze restaurant performance, customer preferences, and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.
